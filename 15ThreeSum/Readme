The difficulty of this problem is whether it has the capability to couple with long inputs

The solution1(O(nÔºÅ/[(n-3)!3!])  and solution2 with python itertool-combination should travel the entire input, which make the
solutions quite slow.

The direction of solving the problem is find the other two nunbers which can sum to 0, when giving one number i
Recall the 1TwoSum problem
